## About the project

The project includes implementing algorithms for Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Decisions Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours, K-Means Clustering and Naive Bayes. This was a part of a Machine Learning course taught at the Otto Von Guericke University in Magdeburg, Germany. The goal of the course was to discuss and implement the aforementioned Machine Learning algorithms. The data was generated by the Department of Informatics.
